# Firebangs

#### Browser extension that allows the use of DuckDuckGo's Bangs in other search engines

### How does it work?
Imagine you want to search for something on a site like Wikipedia. Instead of going to the side and entering
the search query, you can do it all in one step with a simple "!" shortcut!

For example, the query `!yt complete java course` resolves to `https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=complete+java+course`

### Update/modify Bangs

All Bangs are currently loaded from `assets/bangs.json`.
If you want the latest official Bangs, go to https://duckduckgo.com/bang.js
and replace the content of `assets/bangs.json` with it.

### Which browsers are supported?

This extension was tested on Chrome and Firefox.
